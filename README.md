* word2vec.py
  word2vec implementation, You can use Hierarchical softmax, Negative Sampling, Subsampling (Skip_gram, CBOW)

* fast.py 
  fast_text implementation, You can use Negative Sampling, Subsampling (Skip_gram, CBOW)

* fastclassification.py 
  fast text based classification the result is 0.90 almost same as paper presented 92.5(h = 10, bigram).
  The difference of accuracy is from batch or lr setting (In my opinion).
